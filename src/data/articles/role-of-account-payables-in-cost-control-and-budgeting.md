## Budgetary Control Steps for Budget Holders

Budgetary control is a key part of managing a company's finances. It helps organizations plan, watch, and control their spending.

### Establishing actual budgetary positions

The first step is to figure out the actual budgetary positions. This means finding out how much money is available for each part of the budget. To do this, budget holders gather financial data, look at past spending, and think about future plans. They list all possible expenses and estimate how much each will cost, considering things like rising prices and market trends. Then, they review and get approval for these budget amounts from people in charge, like department heads and senior management.

### Comparing actual results to budgeted figures

Next, they regularly compare what they actually spend to what they planned to spend. This involves keeping track of expenses, seeing where they differ from the budget, and trying to understand why these differences happened. They write down their findings in a report.

### Performing variance calculations and analysis

Understanding these differences in spending is important. They calculate variances, which can show where they spent less or more than planned. These calculations help identify where they can save money and where they need to spend more. They look at different types of expenses, like fixed costs that don't change and variable costs that can go up or down.

### Taking corrective action based on variance analysis​​

If they find big differences between what was planned and what was actually spent, they need to take action. This might mean finding ways to spend less, like getting better deals from suppliers, making processes more efficient, or cutting out unnecessary costs. They might also need to change the budget to better match what's really happening. It's important to tell everyone involved about these changes to make sure everyone understands and agrees.
