Check the vendor master files for a lot of sellers that aren't active or that are listed more than once, especially those that get big contracts out of the blue. Watch out for things like checks that don't show up, signatures that don't match, and sellers saying they haven't been paid or were paid late when your records show they have been. Also, keep an eye out for workers who seem to be spending more than they have, as this could mean they are getting paid by fraud vendors.
